# Specs

## AI Guidline

- Follow example module at : `/src/app/examples`: project structure, naming convention, file structure, code style, standard features, etc.
- IMPORTANT: Always read the files inside the module to understand the coding style and structure.
- always read route in `/src/app/routes.tsx` & menu in `/src/app/layout.tsx` to understand the structure and update them when create new module.
- Always use dummy data
- Use local component instead of global component, except for common component like `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, etc.
- Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS)
