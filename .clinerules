# Modules Specification

## NOTE

- DONT MAKE the [resource].md file just understand it
- Make dummy file with constant variable

A web-based application to manage a generic resource. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations such as listing items, viewing details, creating new items, and editing or deleting existing items. The application leverages file-based routing to automatically generate routes based on the file structure.

## File-based Routing Structure

### List Page (Read)

- **File Path:** `/src/app/[resource]/page.jsx`
- **Example File** `cline/examples/list.jsx`
- **Important Note** use all component describe in examples/list.jsx dont try make any other custom component
- **Route:** `/[resource]`
- **Features:**
  - Displays a list of items for the resource.
  - Supports features like search, filtering, and sorting.
  - Main focus is on listing items with navigation to create, edit, or view details.
  - Sample data and data properties will be defined via prompt.

### Detail Page (Read)

- **File Path:** `/src/app/[resource]/[id]/page.jsx`
- **Example File** `cline/examples/detail.jsx`
- **Route:** `/[resource]/:id`
- **Features:**
  - Shows detailed information for a selected item.
  - Includes a back button to return to the list page.

### Edit Page (Update)

- **File Path:** `/src/app/[resource]/[id]/update/page.jsx`
- **Example File** `cline/examples/update.jsx`
- **Route:** `/[resource]/:id/edit`
- **Features:**
  - Provides a form for updating an existing item.
  - Pre-fills fields with the current item data.
  - Includes validation rules (e.g., required fields).
  - Contains actions such as a back button, cancel button, and submit button to save changes.

### Create Page (Create)

- **File Path:** `/src/app/[resource]/create/page.jsx`
- **Example File** `cline/examples/create.jsx`
- **Route:** `/[resource]/create`
- **Features:**
  - Provides a form to create a new item.
  - Includes validation rules (e.g., required fields).
  - Contains actions such as a back button, cancel button, and submit button to save the new item.

## Additonal Note
- Create the same form between create and update page
  - **File Path:** `/src/app/[resource]/_components/form.jsx`
  - **Example File** `cline/examples/form.jsx`
- Dont forget to add a section [resource] to SIDEBAR_ITEMS located on `/src/app/layout.jsx`

# AI File-Based Routing Generation Rules

# VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION

DONT MAKE new FILE [resource].md inside cline/specs folder, just understand the file dont try to make any other file on `cline/specs`

THIS IS VITE with react-router dont act like this is NEXTJS APP

USE react-router instead of react-router-dom

## 1. Scope of Markdown Files

- **Only** read markdown files located in the `cline/specs` folder.
- Do **not** read any files outside of the `cline` folder.

## 2. Understanding User Requests

- **Full CRUD Request:**
  - If a user says, "make me a [resource] page", it means they want a full CRUD implementation for that resource (i.e., Create, Read, Update, and Delete pages).
- **Specific Page Request:**
  - If a user explicitly says, "make me just a [resource] create page" (or any other specific action), it means they want **only** that specific page (in this example, just the Create Page).
  - In this case, only the specs for the corresponding section (e.g., Create) should be read and used.

## 3. Examples

- **Full CRUD Example:**
  - User Query: "make me a books page"
  - Action: Generate full CRUD pages (List, Detail, Edit, Create, etc.) for the "books" resource.
- **Specific Page Example:**
  - User Query: "make me just a books create page"
  - Action: Generate only the Create Page for the "books" resource by reading the specs from the Create section.

## 4. Working Apps
- This code was a working app, dont change anything beside your task.

## 5. Dependency
- Before using any dependencies, look at package.json file to check wether the dependency installed or not

Follow these rules to correctly interpret the user's needs and generate the appropriate file-based routing structure.
