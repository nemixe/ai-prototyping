# AI File-Based Routing Generation Rules

# VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION

DONT MAKE new FILE [resource].md inside .cline/specs folder, just understand the file dont try to make any other file on `.cline/specs`

THIS IS VITE with React Router DOM dont act like this is NEXTJS APP

## 1. Scope of Markdown Files

- **Only** read markdown files located in the `.cline/specs` folder.
- Do **not** read any files outside of the `.cline` folder.

## 2. Understanding User Requests

- **Full CRUD Request:**
  - If a user says, "make me a [resource] page", it means they want a full CRUD implementation for that resource (i.e., Create, Read, Update, and Delete pages).
- **Specific Page Request:**
  - If a user explicitly says, "make me just a [resource] create page" (or any other specific action), it means they want **only** that specific page (in this example, just the Create Page).
  - In this case, only the specs for the corresponding section (e.g., Create) should be read and used.

## 3. Examples

- **Full CRUD Example:**
  - User Query: "make me a books page"
  - Action: Generate full CRUD pages (List, Detail, Edit, Create, etc.) for the "books" resource.
- **Specific Page Example:**
  - User Query: "make me just a books create page"
  - Action: Generate only the Create Page for the "books" resource by reading the specs from the Create section.

Follow these rules to correctly interpret the user's needs and generate the appropriate file-based routing structure.
